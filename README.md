- Project motivation: We decided to work on this dataset because Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains one of the leading causes of death and morbidity worldwide. Its rate has been increasing and itâ€™s affecting the majority of adults. In order to effectively combat this global health issue we will study and analyze the data; to have a better understanding of ASCVD relevant data, enabling us to have an accurate risk assessment, optimize treatment strategies, and provide early detection and estimation of potential risk.
